## Introduction
Credit card fraud occurs when unauthorized and fraudulent transactions are made using someone else's credit card information. This can happen through various means, including:

- **Stolen Cards:** Physical theft of credit cards or card information.
- **Skimming:** Illegitimate card readers capture and store card information during a legitimate transaction.
- **Phishing:** Fraudsters use deceptive emails or websites to trick individuals into providing their credit card details.
- **Data Breaches:** Hackers gain unauthorized access to databases containing credit card information.
- **Carding:** Testing stolen credit card information by making small transactions to verify if the card is still active.

Detecting and preventing credit card fraud is crucial to protecting individuals and financial institutions from financial losses and maintaining trust in electronic payment systems. Machine learning models are often employed to analyze transaction patterns and identify anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity.
